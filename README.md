# My new personal Portfolio

As I am actively searching for a job and as I think a beatiful and clean portfolio helps to cause a good first impression, I decided to crearte a new version of my personal portfolio. It is based on a clean and simple design, including light/dark mode. Key features:

- It will recognise your computer settings to first load on light/dark mode. After the first time visiting the page, it will remember which mode you chose and the next time you visit the page it will load that mode. This causing a nice user experience.
- Possibility to download my CV.
- List of projects I have worked on. Separated into own created projects and projects part of online courses.
- Contact form using EmailJS.

## Tech used

React, CSS & EmailJS.
